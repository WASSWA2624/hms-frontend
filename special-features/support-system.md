# Global Country-Agnostic Support System

> **Goal:** Provide seamless, professional, and scalable support to all subscribers without revealing the country, identity, or individuals behind the system — while improving retention and lifetime value.

---

## 1. Support Philosophy

1. **Product, Not People**
   Users interact with the *platform*, not individuals.

2. **Asynchronous by Default**
   Async support scales globally and removes time-zone friction.

3. **Context-Aware Always**
   Support knows *where* the user is and *what* they’re doing.

4. **Invisible Intelligence**
   Users never know whether help is AI-assisted or human.

5. **Support = Retention Engine**
   Every interaction improves stickiness and expansion.

---

## 2. Support Entry Points

Support is accessible everywhere, without friction:

* Persistent **Help & Support** button (app-wide)
* Contextual **“Need help?”** prompts
* Links embedded in system emails
* Error-state assistance ("Something went wrong → Get help")

> No phone numbers. No personal emails. No external chat apps.

---

## 3. User Identification & Intelligent Routing

> **Principle:** Users willingly identify themselves for better help, but this information is used **only for routing and context**, never exposed back to them.

### What the User Provides

When requesting assistance, the user confirms or enters:

* Name
* Email address
* Facility name
* Tenant / Workspace (auto-selected if logged in)
* Country
* Preferred language

This step is presented as:

> *“Help us route your request to the right support assistant.”*

---

### What the System Infers Automatically

Without asking the user:

* Facility type
* Subscription plan
* Active module
* Page / workflow context
* Usage history
* Error logs (if applicable)

---

### Intelligent Routing Logic

Based on the combined data, the system routes the request to:

* The correct **language-capable assistant**
* The correct **domain expertise** (clinic, lab, pharmacy, hospital)
* The correct **priority queue** (based on plan)

Routing happens silently. No explanation is shown to the user.

---

### Identity Isolation Rule (Critical)

Even though the user shares:

* Country
* Language
* Facility details

The system **never reveals**:

* The responder’s country
* The responder’s identity
* The responder’s language capability
* Whether the responder is human or AI

All replies remain signed as:

> **Healthcare Platform Support**

---

## 4. Tiered Support Architecture

### Tier 1: Self-Serve Knowledge System (Default)

**Shown first, always**

Components:

* Smart searchable knowledge base
* Short task-based guides (1–3 steps)
* 60–90 second explainer videos
* FAQs auto-filtered by module

Context rules:

* Help content adapts to the current module
* Facility type filters answers automatically

---

### Tier 2: In‑App Support Tickets (Asynchronous)

If self‑serve doesn’t resolve the issue:

User submits a ticket containing:

* Issue description
* Optional screenshot / file

Automatically attached by system:

* Tenant ID
* Facility type
* Active module
* Page URL
* Browser / device metadata

User sees:

* Ticket ID
* Status (Open → In Progress → Resolved)

No names. No locations.

---

### Tier 3: Plan‑Based Priority Support

Support priority is determined by **subscription plan**, not individuals.

* Trial / Free → Standard SLA
* Paid → Faster SLA
* Enterprise → Priority SLA

Messaging example:

> “Priority support is included in your plan.”

---

## 4. AI‑Assisted First Response Layer

### How It Works

* AI suggests instant answers from:

  * Documentation
  * Known resolutions
  * Usage patterns
* If confidence is low, ticket escalates silently

User never knows:

* If the responder is AI or human
* Where the responder is located

---

## 5. Tone, Language & Identity Rules

All support communication must:

* Use neutral, global English
* Avoid slang, idioms, or regional phrases
* Avoid time‑zone references (e.g., “today”, “tomorrow”)
* Avoid cultural references
* Avoid personal names

### Signature Standard

> **Healthcare Platform Support**
> *We’re here to help.*

---

## 6. UI & UX Guidelines

* Support UI is minimal and calm
* No avatars or profile photos
* No agent names or bios
* Clean system‑like responses

Status updates are system‑driven, e.g.:

* “Your request is being reviewed.”
* “A solution has been applied.”
* “This issue is resolved.”

---

## 7. Security & Trust

* All support actions are logged
* No sensitive patient data requested in tickets
* Attachments are encrypted
* Access controlled by role & tenant

---

## 8. Support as a Retention Engine

Support interactions can trigger:

* Guided tips after repeated issues
* Suggestions to enable relevant modules
* Alerts when usage patterns change

Examples:

* “Facilities like yours often enable Inventory at this stage.”
* “This feature may resolve similar future issues — enable it?”

---

## 9. Metrics to Track

* Time to first response
* Resolution time by plan
* Most searched help topics
* Repeated issues per tenant
* Support‑driven upgrades

---

## 10. Outcome

Users feel:

> “This system is reliable, professional, and always available.”

You achieve:

* Global credibility
* Low support cost
* High retention
* Scalable growth
