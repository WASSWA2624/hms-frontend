# Intelligent Self‑Serve Onboarding & Retention Journey

> **Goal:** Enable any healthcare business (clinic, pharmacy, hospital, diagnostic centre, etc.) to go from **online advert → live system → payment → long‑term retention** with **zero human intervention**, while hiding system complexity and progressively unlocking value.

---

## 1. Core Principles

1. **One Entry Point, Many Outcomes**
   Everyone starts the same way. Intelligence happens *after signup*.

2. **Ask Less, Infer More**
   The system infers workflows, modules, and defaults from a few signals.

3. **Value First, Payment Second**
   Users experience real value before being asked to pay.

4. **Progressive Disclosure**
   Advanced modules are revealed only when relevant.

5. **Grow With the Facility**
   The system expands naturally as the client grows.

### Automatic Resume-Onboarding Link

Immediately after signup, the system sends an email containing:

* A **secure resume-onboarding link**
* No OTPs, no codes, no friction

The link allows the user to:

* Resume onboarding from any device
* Continue exactly where they stopped
* Access their workspace even if the browser was closed

> **Principle:** Onboarding state is saved after every step.

## 4. Intelligent Auto‑Provisioning (Behind the Scenes)

Immediately after signup, the system:

* Creates a **tenant**
