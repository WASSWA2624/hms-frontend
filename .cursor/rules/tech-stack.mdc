# Technology Stack & Module Standards

## Purpose
Define the approved stack, versions, and allowed module choices.
This file owns dependency/version policy for runtime and tooling.

## Language and Module System
- Source code is JavaScript only (`.js`, `.jsx`).
- ES modules are required in `src/**`.
- Module-system exceptions are owned by `coding-conventions.mdc`.

## Core Frameworks
| Technology | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React Native | `0.81.5` | Native app runtime |
| Expo SDK | `~54.0.32` | App platform/toolchain |
| React | `19.1.0` | UI runtime |
| React DOM | `19.1.0` | Web rendering |
| React Native Web | `^0.21.0` | Cross-platform web support |

## Approved Runtime Libraries
### State and Routing
| Library | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redux Toolkit | `^2.11.2` | Global state |
| React-Redux | `^9.2.0` | Redux bindings |
| Redux Persist | `^6.0.0` | Store persistence |
| Expo App Router | `~6.0.22` | Routing |
| @remix-run/router | `^1.23.0` | Router dependency |

### UI and Theme
| Library | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| styled-components | `^6.1.19` | Styling system |
| react-native-safe-area-context | `~5.6.0` | Safe area handling |
| expo-status-bar | `~3.0.9` | Status bar UI |

### Validation, Storage, Connectivity
| Library | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zod | `^4.2.1` | Runtime validation |
| @react-native-async-storage/async-storage | `2.2.0` | Non-sensitive persistence |
| expo-secure-store | `~15.0.8` | Sensitive credential storage |
| @react-native-community/netinfo | `11.4.1` | Connectivity state |
| expo-localization | `^17.0.8` | Locale and formatting helpers |

### Testing and Quality
| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jest | `^29.7.0` | Test runner |
| jest-expo | `^54.0.2` | Expo test preset |
| @testing-library/react-native | `^13.3.3` | UI behavior tests |
| @testing-library/jest-native | `^5.4.3` | RN matchers |
| react-test-renderer | `19.1.0` | Renderer support |
| ESLint | `^9.39.2` | Linting |
| Prettier | `^3.7.4` | Formatting |

## Networking Rule
- Network requests use the built-in Fetch API via service wrappers.
- API orchestration and auth header handling are owned by `services-integration.mdc`.

## Optional Libraries
Optional packages (for example `react-native-svg`, `react-native-gesture-handler`) require dependency approval from `dependency-policy.mdc` before adoption.

## Change Rules
When dependencies change:
1. Update this file in the same change.
2. Validate compatibility on Android, iOS, and Web.
3. Update related `dev-plan/` notes if behavior/process changes.
