# Internationalization (i18n) & Localization Standards

## Purpose
Ensure all user-facing experiences are translatable, locale-aware, and resilient across Android, iOS, and Web.

## Core Rules
- No hardcoded user-facing UI text in components/screens.
- UI text must resolve through i18n keys (`t()`/equivalent project API).
- Translation keys must exist in every supported locale file before use.
- Missing keys must fail safely with fallback behavior, never app crash.

## Source of Truth
```txt
src/i18n/
  index.js
  locales/
    en.json
    <locale>.json
```

Locale JSON files in `src/i18n/locales/` are the authoritative translation catalog.

## Key Design
- Use stable, descriptive dot-path keys (for example: `auth.login.submit`).
- Keep domain grouping consistent (`common.*`, `errors.*`, `forms.*`, `navigation.*`).
- Avoid temporary/generic key names.

## Runtime Behavior
- Default locale comes from device/browser locale with persistent user override.
- Fallback locale is English (`en`).
- Use `Intl` APIs for dates, numbers, and currency formatting.
- Support RTL text and layout behavior where applicable.

## Process Requirements
1. Add new keys to all locale files.
2. Use keys in code (no string literals for user-visible text).
3. Validate rendering for supported locales.
