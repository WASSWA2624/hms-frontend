# Project Rules Index

## Purpose
`index.mdc` is the table of contents and precedence map for all project rules.
It does not define implementation details that belong to area-specific rule files.

## Conflict Resolution
Use this order when two statements appear to conflict:
1. Security and compliance rules
2. The area owner listed in "Rule Ownership"
3. `core-principles.mdc` for tradeoff direction
4. Other supporting rule files

If a non-owner file repeats owner policy, the owner file is authoritative.

## Rule Documents
- [Core development principles](./core-principles.mdc) - high-level engineering principles
- [Tech stack & modules](./tech-stack.mdc) - approved dependency list and versions
- [Dependency minimization policy](./dependency-policy.mdc)
- [Project structure & architecture](./project-structure.mdc)
- [App Router & navigation](./app-router.mdc) - routing conventions and boundaries
- [Platform UI layer](./platform-ui.mdc)
- [UI component structure](./component-structure.mdc) - platform folder/file conventions
- [Theme & design system](./theme-design.mdc) - theming and styling rules
- [State management (Redux Toolkit)](./state-management.mdc)
- [Features & domain rules](./features-domain.mdc)
- [Services & integrations](./services-integration.mdc)
- [Hooks & utilities](./hooks-utils.mdc)
- [Offline-first architecture](./offline-sync.mdc)
- [Security standards](./security.mdc)
- [Internationalization (i18n) & localization](./i18n.mdc)
- [Accessibility (a11y) & User Experience (UX)](./accessibility.mdc)
- [Performance & efficiency](./performance.mdc)
- [Errors & logging](./errors-logging.mdc)
- [Debug system](./debug.mdc) - development-only debugging workflow
- [Bootstrap & configuration](./bootstrap-config.mdc) - startup and provider placement
- [Coding conventions, enforcement & change policy](./coding-conventions.mdc)
- [Testing strategy](./testing.mdc)

## Rule Ownership
- Dependencies and versions: `tech-stack.mdc`
- Dependency approval process: `dependency-policy.mdc`
- Module system, naming, imports/exports, side-effect placement: `coding-conventions.mdc`
- Architecture boundaries and folder ownership: `project-structure.mdc`
- Routing and navigation constraints: `app-router.mdc`
- Platform component/screen folder and file conventions: `component-structure.mdc`
- UI layer behavior constraints: `platform-ui.mdc`
- Theme and styling constraints: `theme-design.mdc`
- Global provider placement and startup order: `bootstrap-config.mdc`
- State management rules: `state-management.mdc`
- Feature/domain boundaries: `features-domain.mdc`
- Service/integration boundaries: `services-integration.mdc`
- Hook and utility constraints: `hooks-utils.mdc`
- Offline queue/sync behavior: `offline-sync.mdc`
- Security requirements: `security.mdc`
- i18n and locale behavior: `i18n.mdc`
- Accessibility and UX quality bars: `accessibility.mdc`
- Performance budgets and profiling: `performance.mdc`
- Error normalization and logging flow: `errors-logging.mdc`
- Test requirements and coverage policy: `testing.mdc`
- Dev-only debug tooling: `debug.mdc`

## Maintenance Rules
- Keep each file scoped to its owned area.
- If a rule must be mentioned in a non-owner file, keep it short and reference the owner file.
- Update `index.mdc` whenever a rule file is added, removed, or ownership changes.
