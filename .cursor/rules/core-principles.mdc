# Core Development Principles

## Purpose
Provide high-level decision principles used when detailed rule files do not fully cover a case.

## Principles
1. Reusability first: avoid duplicated implementation; extract shared hooks/utilities/components when reuse is real.
2. Modular boundaries: changes in one feature should not require unrelated layer changes.
3. Simplicity: choose the clearest working solution over clever abstractions.
4. Lean dependencies: prefer built-ins and approved stack before new packages.
5. JavaScript-only codebase: no TypeScript source files.
6. Theme-driven styling: follow theme and structure owners (`theme-design.mdc`, `component-structure.mdc`).
7. Responsive by default: mobile-first with support for web/tablet layouts.
8. Performance-aware implementation: prevent avoidable render/network/memory regressions.
9. Security-first behavior: protect data, credentials, and access flows across all layers.

## Priority Order
When principles trade off, use this order:
1. Security
2. Correctness and data integrity
3. Reusability and modularity
4. Simplicity
5. Performance
6. Development convenience
