# Platform UI Layer Standards

## Purpose
Define behavioral constraints for `src/platform` UI code across Android, iOS, and Web.
This file owns runtime UI behavior; file/folder naming is owned by `component-structure.mdc`.

## UI Responsibilities
- Render presentation and user interactions.
- Consume semantic state/actions through hooks.
- Remain platform-aware using shared-first file strategy.

UI must not:
- Contain domain business rules.
- Execute navigation policy logic directly.
- Perform irreversible side effects in render paths.

## Platform Strategy
- Shared implementation first.
- Add platform override files only when behavior or markup truly differs.
- Keep public props/API equivalent across shared and override implementations.

## Composition & State Access
- Prefer composition and hooks over complex component inheritance.
- Screens should orchestrate via hooks/features and stay thin.
- UI should not call store internals directly.

## Import Boundaries
UI may import:
- `@platform/...`
- `@hooks/...`
- `@utils/...`

UI may not import:
- Service internals for business flows
- Store internals (reducers, middleware, persistence internals)
- Infrastructure modules directly for domain actions

## UX Resilience
Each screen must handle loading, empty, error, and offline states without crashing.
