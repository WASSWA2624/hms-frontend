# Debug System Standards

## Purpose
Define the dev-only cross-platform debug logging workflow.
This file covers local debug scripts and generated log files only.

## Folder Ownership
```txt
debug/                # generated *.log output (gitignored)
  .gitkeep
  README.md
  expo-debug.log
  android-debug.log
  ios-debug.log
  web-debug.log

scripts/debug/        # node ESM debug scripts
  expo-with-logging.mjs
  android-debug-logcat.mjs
  ios-debug-logcat.mjs
  web-log-receiver.mjs
  debug-all.mjs

src/debug/            # in-app dev helpers
  web-console-logger.js
```

## Rules
- Debug scripts are ESM (`.mjs`) and run only in development workflows.
- Log files are overwritten on each run (no append accumulation).
- Generated debug logs remain outside source control.
- Web console logger runs only in dev web context and must be a no-op in production/native.

## Integration Notes
- Root app layout imports web console logger once.
- Debug tooling must not affect production behavior or startup critical path.
