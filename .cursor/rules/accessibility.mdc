# Accessibility (a11y) & UX Standards

## Purpose
Define mandatory accessibility and UX quality requirements for Android, iOS, and Web.

## Accessibility Requirements
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum.
- Every interactive control must have accessible labels/hints/roles.
- Minimum touch target size is `44x44px`.
- Keyboard navigation and visible focus states are required on web.
- Screen-reader flows must work for primary journeys.
- Color cannot be the only status signal.
- Contrast must meet WCAG AA targets (`4.5:1` text, `3:1` UI components).
- Images require alt text or explicit decorative treatment.
- Form inputs require associated labels and accessible errors.
- Loading progress and async state changes must be announced accessibly.

## User Preferences
- Respect reduced motion settings.
- Respect system font scaling/dynamic type.
- Respect language settings (owner: `i18n.mdc`).
- Support dark mode via the two-theme system only (`light`/`dark`, owner: `theme-design.mdc`).
- High-contrast needs must be addressed by accessible token values within those two themes, not by adding extra theme variants.

## UX State Requirements
Every user-facing flow must define:
- Loading state
- Empty state
- Error state with recovery action
- Success feedback when meaningful

User-facing errors must be actionable, non-technical, and internationalized.

## Interaction Quality
- Confirm destructive actions.
- Keep primary actions clear and discoverable.
- Keep navigation behavior consistent (back/forward expectations).
- Maintain responsive layouts across mobile, tablet, and web.

## Related
- `theme-design.mdc` (theme/token ownership)
- `i18n.mdc` (translation ownership)
- `performance.mdc` (runtime performance budgets)
- `testing.mdc` (a11y test requirements)

## Forbidden
- Inaccessible controls
- Touch targets smaller than `44x44px`
- Color-only status communication
- Missing loading/empty/error handling
- Raw technical errors shown to end users
