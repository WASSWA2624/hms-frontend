# Dependency Minimization Policy

## Purpose
Keep the codebase lean, maintainable, and secure by minimizing third-party dependencies.

## Mandatory Rules
- Prefer built-in platform/runtime APIs before adding packages.
- Add a dependency only for a concrete, current need.
- Avoid duplicate packages solving the same problem.
- Prefer smaller, actively maintained libraries with clear release cadence.
- Require Android, iOS, and Web compatibility.

## Approval Checklist
Before adding a dependency, document:
1. Why built-ins are insufficient.
2. Bundle/runtime impact.
3. Security posture (maintenance, advisories, release activity).
4. Integration/testing strategy.

## Compatibility Gates
A candidate dependency must pass:
1. Version compatibility with current React/React Native/Expo stack.
2. Multi-platform boot and runtime sanity checks.
3. No overlap/conflict with existing architectural owners.

Dependencies failing any gate must not be merged.

## Documentation Rules
Dependency changes must be committed with:
- `tech-stack.mdc` updates (version + purpose)
- Any required `dev-plan/` updates
- Notes on compatibility validation

Out-of-sync dependency documentation is a policy violation.
