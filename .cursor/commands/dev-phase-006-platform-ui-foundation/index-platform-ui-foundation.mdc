Scope guard:
- This index file is phase metadata only.
- Implementation constraints and enforcement contracts belong to the step prompt files.

Cross-cutting mandatory contract in step prompts:
- Enforce strict role-based visibility and execution controls across routes, nav items, functions/actions, UI components, screens, and screen sections.
