Steps to review and implement (Phase 012 - Tier 6: Executive Analytics):
- **12.19** Executive multi-branch KPI cockpit
- **12.20** Trend and forecasting analytics views
- **12.21** Leadership custom report templates UX

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement advanced UX for selected steps while preserving core-phase stability.
- Reuse existing modules/services/hooks before introducing new abstractions.
- Maintain first-class i18n/accessibility/security behavior for advanced states.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P012_advanced-features.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Advanced scope must align with relevant backend contracts (including `hms-backend/dev-plan/P013_ws_features.mdc` for realtime-selected steps).
- HTTP/API behavior must align with mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and selected module route files.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must visually and behaviorally match mobile web for layout density, typography scale, component sizing, spacing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Platform-specific override files are allowed only for hard platform/accessibility constraints and must preserve parity with mobile web.
- Keep UI simple, modern, compact, stable, and fully responsive across phone, tablet, and web breakpoints.
- Keep user journeys chronological and obvious for first-time users: clear actions, short labels, and minimal friction.
- Prefer consolidating related actions on one screen when it reduces fragmentation and cognitive load.
- Auto-resolve and hide known context parameters (tenant, facility, branch, user, encounter, and similar context) unless user input is mandatory by contract or compliance.
- Do not show internal model IDs in UI. Display human-readable business IDs/labels from backend or domain data contracts.
- Keep navigation straightforward with stable route structure, stable nav items, and consistent placement of controls.
- Reuse shared platform components/patterns/tokens first; avoid ad-hoc one-off UI implementations.
- Add concise contextual help for critical decisions and keep instructional copy short and local to the action.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this contract.

## Role-Based Visibility and Access Enforcement Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches auth, routing, navigation, data access, or UI:
- Users must never see or execute anything outside their role and permission scope.
- Ensure each role sees the routes, nav items, screens, sections, components, and actions required for their responsibilities; missing required access is a defect.
- Enforce access at multiple layers: menu item visibility, route/screen guards, section-level rendering, component-level rendering, and action/function-level handlers.
- Hide unauthorized menu items, tabs, widgets, buttons, fields, cards, and screen sections by default; do not expose privileged controls unless explicitly required by approved requirements.
- Block unauthorized function/action execution even when UI is bypassed (direct URL entry, deep links, state tampering, manual event triggering).
- Use a single source of truth for access checks across web, Android, and iOS to prevent behavior drift.
- Use canonical backend role names and permission contracts as defined by `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/index.mdc` and backend auth/rbac contracts.
- Provide deterministic denied-access UX (safe redirect, read-only fallback, or localized permission message) without leaking sensitive details.
- Add/update tests that verify protected and required role paths: menu visibility, required route availability, route guards, screen/section/component rendering, and denied function/action paths.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 012 Tier 6.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs after confirming all earlier step IDs in the same phase/tier are already complete; if not, complete missing earlier steps first (no chronology skips).
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps unless an earlier required prerequisite is needed to satisfy mandatory chronology gates.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- Selected advanced route surfaces under `src/app/**`
- Selected feature-domain extensions under `src/features/**` and `src/hooks/**`
- Targeted tests for selected advanced workflows and failure paths

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT expand beyond selected advanced tier steps.
- Do NOT assume unsupported realtime/backend capabilities.
- Do NOT regress baseline core feature behavior from phases 10/11.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
