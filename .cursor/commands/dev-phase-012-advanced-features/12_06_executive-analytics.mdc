Steps to review and implement (Phase 012 - Tier 6: Executive Analytics):
- **12.19** Executive multi-branch KPI cockpit
- **12.20** Trend and forecasting analytics views
- **12.21** Leadership custom report templates UX

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement advanced UX for selected steps while preserving core-phase stability.
- Reuse existing modules/services/hooks before introducing new abstractions.
- Maintain first-class i18n/accessibility/security behavior for advanced states.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P012_advanced-features.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Advanced realtime scope must align with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P013_ws_features.mdc`.
- HTTP/API behavior must align with mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and selected module route files.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must match mobile web UI for layout, spacing density, typography scale, component sizing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Only create .android or .ios overrides when required by hard platform constraints or accessibility requirements.
- When overrides are required, keep visual and interaction parity with mobile web.
- Prioritize simplicity and space economy: compact layouts, short labels, short helper text, and minimal non-essential copy.
- Add inline/in-app guidance for critical user actions using concise contextual hints and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid long instructional paragraphs in screens; guidance must be brief, actionable, and local to the current step.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this parity and compactness contract.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 012 Tier 6.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs.
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- Selected advanced route surfaces under `src/app/**`
- Selected feature-domain extensions under `src/features/**` and `src/hooks/**`
- Targeted tests for selected advanced workflows and failure paths

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT expand beyond selected advanced tier steps.
- Do NOT assume unsupported realtime/backend capabilities.
- Do NOT regress baseline core feature behavior from phases 10/11.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
