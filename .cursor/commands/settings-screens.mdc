# Step 11.3.5 — Departments Screen Implementation Prompt

Review and implement **11.3.5** Department -- `(main)/settings/departments` as per: `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md`
Must be **100% compliant** with:
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules`
- HMS backend contracts
- Onboarding journey and app write-up
Do not implement anything outside this step unless strictly required for CRUD to function.
## Scope
Implement full CRUD for this step: List, Create, Edit, Delete(with confirmation), View details (if defined by backend/spec), Loading, empty, and error states, Success/failure feedback for every action.
All operations must match backend schema and endpoints exactly.
## Layout Rules (Strict)
- Designed like the existing **Dashboard main layout**
- Use **only main layout scroll** — no nested scroll containers
- No nested sidebar
- Use standard breadcrumb + back navigation
- Match other dashboard screens visually and structurally
## UI / UX Rules
- Lightweight, clean, modern, dashboard-consistent
- Compact spacing and components
- No oversized elements
- No duplicate or unnecessary UI
### Buttons
- Same style as breadcrumb back button
- Theme background + icon
- Compact and consistent
### Forms
- Clear labels
- Helpful placeholders/descriptions
- Inline validation
- Required fields obvious
- Logical field order
- Next actions clear
### Navigation
- Back and Cancel actions present
- No dead ends
- Contextual navigation where useful
## Reliability
- Graceful API and network error handling
- Human-readable, actionable error messages
- Clear success and failure feedback for every CRUD action
- User flow must feel guided and safe
## Constraints
Do NOT:
- Change layout or routing architecture
- Add global components or patterns
- Invent backend fields or behaviors
- Introduce nested scrolling
## Acceptance Criteria
- 100% compliance to rules
- Backend-aligned CRUD working
- No nested scroll
- Clear feedback on all actions
- First-time users can complete tasks without external help
