**11.3.2** Tenant -- `(main)/settings/tenants`

Review and implement all missing and non compliant aspects of the above dev sptep as per `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md`.

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*`
- Backend contracts in `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc` for the selected settings resource
- `write-up.md`

Only implement what is required for this single Tier 3 screen to function correctly.

---

## Scope

Implement full functionality required for the selected Tier 3 step (`11.3.1` to `11.3.22`):

- Route + screen wiring under `(main)/settings/*`
- Backend-aligned API integration for the selected settings entity
- Loading, empty, error, and success states
- Validation for all create/edit inputs
- List, detail, create, edit, and delete flows where backend supports them
- Read-only behavior where create/edit is intentionally not supported (for example `11.3.18` and `11.3.21`)
- Navigation (Back / Cancel / Save) with no dead ends
- Prefill known fields and use select controls for known relations where applicable

Do NOT implement steps outside Tier 3.

---

## Layout Rules (Strict)

- Reuse existing **Main Layout** and **Settings Layout**
- No layout redesign
- No nested scroll containers
- No nested sidebars
- Use existing breadcrumb and route navigation patterns
- Match current settings screens visually and structurally

---

## UI / UX Rules

- Clean, compact, modern UI
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop, web, iOS, Android)
- Clear action hierarchy
- Human-friendly copy via i18n keys only
- No duplicate UI
- No oversized elements
- No dead-end navigation

Buttons:
- Use existing settings/main button styles
- Compact and consistent

Forms:
- Clear labels and helpful placeholders
- Inline validation messages
- Required fields clearly indicated
- Logical field order

---

## Reliability

- Handle API/network errors gracefully
- Human-readable, actionable error messages
- Clear success/failure feedback for every supported action
- Disable invalid actions based on validation and dependencies
- Preserve user state where possible

All operations MUST match backend schema and endpoint behavior exactly.

---

## Constraints

Do NOT:

- Modify auth/onboarding flows
- Change layout or routing architecture
- Add global components or new patterns
- Invent backend fields or behaviors
- Implement screens outside Tier 3

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- 100% rules compliance
- Existing main/settings layouts reused
- Backend-aligned functionality for the selected Tier 3 step
- Responsive UI with clear validation and feedback
- No nested scroll
- Screen works independently and integrates with current settings navigation

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Screen/Page component(s) for the selected Tier 3 step
2. Form component(s) (if applicable)
3. API integration hook usage/updates (if applicable)
4. Validation logic (if applicable)
5. State handling logic
6. Loading + empty + error UI
7. Success/failure feedback implementation
8. Navigation handlers
9. Backend contract alignment confirmation

Do NOT include files or logic outside the selected Tier 3 screen.
