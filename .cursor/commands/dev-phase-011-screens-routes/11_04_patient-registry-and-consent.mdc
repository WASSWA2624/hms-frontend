Steps to review and implement (Phase 011 - Tier 4: Patient Registry and Consent):
- **11.4.1** Patients home - `(main)/patients`
- **11.4.2** Patients - `(main)/patients/patients` - backend `patient`
- **11.4.3** Patient identifiers - `(main)/patients/patient-identifiers` - backend `patient-identifier`
- **11.4.4** Patient contacts - `(main)/patients/patient-contacts` - backend `patient-contact`
- **11.4.5** Patient guardians - `(main)/patients/patient-guardians` - backend `patient-guardian`
- **11.4.6** Patient allergies - `(main)/patients/patient-allergies` - backend `patient-allergy`
- **11.4.7** Patient medical histories - `(main)/patients/patient-medical-histories` - backend `patient-medical-history`
- **11.4.8** Patient documents - `(main)/patients/patient-documents` - backend `patient-document`
- **11.4.9** Consents - `(main)/patients/consents` - backend `consent`
- **11.4.10** Terms acceptances - `(main)/patients/terms-acceptances` - backend `terms-acceptance`

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement selected screen/route wiring and interactions for this tier only.
- Ensure end-to-end backend linkage for enabled actions and read-only fallbacks for unsupported actions.
- Apply route/action access control, accessibility semantics, and resilient loading/error/offline states.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Contracts must align with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc`.
- Mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and selected module route files are source of truth.
- Use only mounted backend resources/actions from `hms-backend/src/app/router.js`; if an action is absent in contract, keep role-aware read-only/informational UX.
- If backend changes are required, comply fully with `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/*`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must match mobile web UI for layout, spacing density, typography scale, component sizing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Only create .android or .ios overrides when required by hard platform constraints or accessibility requirements.
- When overrides are required, keep visual and interaction parity with mobile web.
- Prioritize simplicity and space economy: compact layouts, short labels, short helper text, and minimal non-essential copy.
- Add inline/in-app guidance for critical user actions using concise contextual hints and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid long instructional paragraphs in screens; guidance must be brief, actionable, and local to the current step.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this parity and compactness contract.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 011 Tier 4.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs.
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- `src/app/**` route files and group layouts for selected tier step(s)
- Selected `src/features/**`, `src/hooks/**`, and form components required by tier screens
- Tests under `src/__tests__/**` covering selected tier routes, actions, and edge states

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT implement steps from other tiers unless minimal prerequisite wiring is required.
- Do NOT call non-mounted backend endpoints or invent shortcut routes.
- Do NOT bypass route-level auth/role guards.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
