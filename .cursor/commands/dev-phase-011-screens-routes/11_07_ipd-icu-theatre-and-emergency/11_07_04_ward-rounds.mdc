Step file for **11.7.4** - Ward rounds.
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.7.4`
- Route: `(main)/ipd/ward-rounds`
- Backend module: `ward-round`
- Action mode: Full route surface (list/detail/create/edit).

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/ward-rounds/index.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/ward-rounds/[id].jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/ward-rounds/create.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/ward-rounds/[id]/edit.jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/**/*WardroundsListScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/**/*WardroundsDetailScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/**/*WardroundsFormScreen/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/ipd-icu-theatre-emergency-routes.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- List route (`index`): compact toolbar/actions and deterministic loading/empty/error/offline states.
- Detail route (`[id]`): human-readable field rendering, role-aware actions, and explicit recovery/back navigation.
- Form routes (`create` / `[id]/edit` where mounted): enforce validation, role-aware submit, and clear cancel/back handoff.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
## Shared Contract Enforcement (Mandatory)
- This file inherits and must fully comply with ../00_shared-contracts.mdc.
- All mandatory contracts in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are required for work executed from this prompt.
- ../00_shared-contracts.mdc has precedence over this file; if instructions conflict, the shared contract wins.
- A task is complete only when this file and every mandatory requirement in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are satisfied.
