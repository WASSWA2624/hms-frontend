Step file for **11.7.7** - Discharge summaries.
Load `11_07_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.7.7`
- Route: `(main)/ipd/discharge-summaries`
- Backend module: `discharge-summary`
- Action mode: Full route surface (list/detail/create/edit).

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/discharge-summaries/index.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/discharge-summaries/[id].jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/discharge-summaries/create.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/ipd/discharge-summaries/[id]/edit.jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/**/*DischargesummariesListScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/**/*DischargesummariesDetailScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/**/*DischargesummariesFormScreen/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/ipd-icu-theatre-emergency-routes.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_07_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- List route (`index`): compact toolbar/actions and deterministic loading/empty/error/offline states.
- Detail route (`[id]`): human-readable field rendering, role-aware actions, and explicit recovery/back navigation.
- Form routes (`create` / `[id]/edit` where mounted): enforce validation, role-aware submit, and clear cancel/back handoff.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
