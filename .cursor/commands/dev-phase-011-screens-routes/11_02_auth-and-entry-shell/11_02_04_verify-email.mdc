Step file for **11.2.4** - Verify email.
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.2.4`
- Route: `(auth)/verify-email`
- Backend module: `auth`
- Action mode: Email verification flow.

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(auth)/_layout.jsx`
- `src/app/(auth)/verify-email.jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/auth/VerifyEmailScreen/**`
- `src/app/shared/withRouteTermsAcceptance.jsx`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(auth)/entry-shell-routes.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/auth-route-group.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/auth-layout-guard.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Verify-email route: handle token validation/resend with deterministic success and retry messaging.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
## Shared Contract Enforcement (Mandatory)
- This file inherits and must fully comply with ../00_shared-contracts.mdc.
- All mandatory contracts in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are required for work executed from this prompt.
- ../00_shared-contracts.mdc has precedence over this file; if instructions conflict, the shared contract wins.
- A task is complete only when this file and every mandatory requirement in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are satisfied.
