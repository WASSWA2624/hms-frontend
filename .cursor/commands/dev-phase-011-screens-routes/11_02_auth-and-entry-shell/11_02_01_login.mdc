Step file for **11.2.1** - Login.
Load `11_02_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.2.1`
- Route: `(auth)/login`
- Backend module: `auth`
- Action mode: Auth login form flow.

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(auth)/_layout.jsx`
- `src/app/(auth)/login.jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/auth/LoginScreen/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(auth)/entry-shell-routes.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/auth-route-group.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/auth-layout-guard.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_02_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Login route: enforce credential validation, role-aware redirects, and clear recovery options.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
