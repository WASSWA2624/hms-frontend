Step file for **11.6.1** - Clinical home.
Load `11_06_encounters-and-clinical-documentation_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.6.1`
- Route: `(main)/clinical`
- Backend module: resolve from route/module contracts.
- Action mode: Home/overview route surface.

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(main)/clinical/index.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/clinical/_layout.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/clinical/[...missing].jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `D:/coding/apps/hms/hms-frontend/src/platform/screens/clinical/ClinicalOverviewScreen/**`
- `D:/coding/apps/hms/hms-frontend/src/platform/screens/clinical/ClinicalScreen/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/clinical-routes.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_06_encounters-and-clinical-documentation_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Home route: ensure overview, nav handoff, and role-aware summaries are compact and deterministic.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
