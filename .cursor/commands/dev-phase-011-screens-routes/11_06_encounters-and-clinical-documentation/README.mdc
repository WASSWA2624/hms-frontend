Phase 011 tier folderized from `11_06_encounters-and-clinical-documentation.mdc` for step-level implementation clarity.

Load order:
1. `../00_shared-contracts.mdc`
2. One or more step files (`11_06_XX_*.mdc`)
3. If the tier is selected as a whole, execute all steps in numeric order.

## Shared Contract Enforcement (Mandatory)
- This file inherits and must fully comply with ../00_shared-contracts.mdc.
- All mandatory contracts in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are required for work executed from this prompt.
- ../00_shared-contracts.mdc has precedence over this file; if instructions conflict, the shared contract wins.
- A task is complete only when this file and every mandatory requirement in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are satisfied.
