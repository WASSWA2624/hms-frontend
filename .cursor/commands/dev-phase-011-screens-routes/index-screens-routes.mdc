Global UX baseline now enforced in each tier prompt:
- Mobile parity and compact UX contract.
- Novice-first UX and navigation contract.
- Strict role- and permission-based visibility, contextual in-app help, chronological flow guidance, and space-efficient reusable UI requirements.
- Strict role-based visibility and execution controls across menu items, functions/actions, UI components, screens, and screen sections.
- User-friendly errors and recovery contract with actionable guidance and non-technical messaging.
- Interconnected functionality coordination contract to enforce end-to-end consistency across linked screens and modules.
