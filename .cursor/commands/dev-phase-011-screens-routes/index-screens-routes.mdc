- Implementation constraints and enforcement contracts belong to the tier prompt files.

Global UX baseline enforced in each tier prompt:
- Mobile parity and compact UX contract.
- Novice-first UX and navigation contract.
- User-friendly errors and recovery contract.
- Total UI component/sub-component compliance review with redesign required for non-compliant UI.
- Interconnected functionality coordination contract.
- Strict role-based visibility and execution controls across routes, nav items, functions/actions, UI components, screens, and screen sections.
