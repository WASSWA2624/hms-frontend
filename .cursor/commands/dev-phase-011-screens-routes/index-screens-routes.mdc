Phase coverage:
- Steps `11.1.1` through `11.11.5` from `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md` (full route/screen parity surface).

Scope guard:
- This index file is phase metadata only.
- Implementation constraints and enforcement contracts belong to the tier prompt files.

Global UX baseline enforced in each tier prompt:
- Mobile parity and compact UX contract.
- Human-readable identity and context-selection contract: no raw UUID/GUID/internal ID exposure to non-super users; use email-first tenant/facility name-based selection and human-readable business IDs where visible IDs are needed.
- Novice-first UX and navigation contract.
- User-friendly errors and recovery contract.
- Total UI component/sub-component compliance review with redesign required for non-compliant UI.
- Interconnected functionality coordination contract.
- Strict role-based visibility and execution controls across routes, nav items, functions/actions, UI components, screens, and screen sections, with main and nested nav items rendered only for roles in the logged-in user's authorized role set.
## Shared Contract Enforcement (Mandatory)
- This file inherits and must fully comply with ./00_shared-contracts.mdc.
- All mandatory contracts in ./00_shared-contracts.mdc are required for work executed from this prompt.
- ./00_shared-contracts.mdc has precedence over this file; if instructions conflict, the shared contract wins.
- A task is complete only when this file and every mandatory requirement in ./00_shared-contracts.mdc are satisfied.
