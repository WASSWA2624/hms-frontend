Deprecated compatibility stub for **11.4.4** - Patient contacts.
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Status
- Deprecated in consolidation cycle.
- Ownership moved to `11_04_03_patient-identifiers.mdc` (Identity & Reachability merged workspace).

## Current Route Contract
- Legacy route files under `src/app/(main)/patients/patient-contacts/**` must remain redirect-only wrappers to:
  - `/patients/patients/:patientId?tab=identity&panel=contacts` when patient context exists
  - `/patients/patients` when context is missing

## Enforcement
- Do not add or restore standalone patient-contacts screens.
- Keep wrapper behavior backward-compatible for deep links until next prune cycle.
