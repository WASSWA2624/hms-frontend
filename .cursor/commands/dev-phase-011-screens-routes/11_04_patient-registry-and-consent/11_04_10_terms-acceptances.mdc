Step file for **11.4.10** - Terms Acceptances (Global Legal Hub).
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.4.10`
- Primary route: `(main)/patients/legal?tab=terms`
- Backend modules: `terms-acceptance` (plus global legal orchestration with `consent`)
- Action mode: Global legal hub operations with role + entitlement guards.

## Owned Route Surface
- Global legal hub route:
  - `src/app/(main)/patients/legal/index.jsx`
- Legacy compatibility redirects:
  - `src/app/(main)/patients/terms-acceptances/**`
  - `src/app/(main)/patients/consents/**` (legal hub redirect compatibility)

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/patients/PatientLegalHubScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/patients/components/**` (field help + inline guide)

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/patients-routes.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/patients/usePatientLegalHubScreen.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Terms acceptances are managed in global legal context, not patient workspace tabs.
- Keep legal hub role-guarded and entitlement-aware with deterministic subscription CTA.
- Keep user/record identity display human-readable.
- Keep legacy terms/consent standalone routes as redirect-only compatibility wrappers.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Legal hub renders global consents + terms tabs.
- [ ] Terms actions are constrained to mounted backend capability (no unsupported update flow).
- [ ] Legacy legal routes redirect to `/patients/legal` tab targets.
- [ ] Tests cover legal hub routing, entitlement block, and create/delete behavior.
