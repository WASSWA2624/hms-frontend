Step file for **11.4.8** - Documents + Patient Consents (Merged Workspace Surface).
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.4.8`
- Primary route: `(main)/patients/patients/[id]?tab=documents|consents`
- Backend modules: `patient-document`, `consent`
- Action mode: In-workspace merged CRUD + compatibility redirects.

## Owned Route Surface
- Workspace tab/panels:
  - `/patients/patients/[id]?tab=documents&panel=documents`
  - `/patients/patients/[id]?tab=consents&panel=consents`
- Legacy compatibility redirects:
  - `src/app/(main)/patients/patient-documents/**`
  - `src/app/(main)/patients/consents/**`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/patients/PatientWorkspaceScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/patients/components/**` (field help + inline guide)

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/patients-routes.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/patients/usePatientWorkspaceScreen.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Keep patient-scoped documents and consents in workspace tabs.
- Do not re-introduce standalone documents/consents route implementations.
- Keep role-guarded actions and entitlement-safe blocked UX.
- Ensure legal/patient identifiers shown in UI remain human-readable.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Workspace documents and consents tabs support merged CRUD.
- [ ] Legacy documents and consents routes redirect to workspace/legal correctly.
- [ ] Help icon and inline guide cover document/consent fields.
- [ ] Tests cover redirect mapping and merged action behavior.
