Phase 011 tier folderized from `11_04_patient-registry-and-consent.mdc` for step-level implementation clarity.

Load order:
1. `../00_shared-contracts.mdc`
2. One or more step files (`11_04_XX_*.mdc`)
3. If the tier is selected as a whole, execute all steps in numeric order.

## Tier 4 Consolidation Contract (Current)
- Primary patient architecture is consolidated around:
  - `/patients/patients` (directory + deep relational search)
  - `/patients/patients/create` (quick-create)
  - `/patients/patients/[id]` (unified workspace tabs)
  - `/patients/legal` (global legal hub)
- Legacy patient subresource routes are compatibility redirects only for one cycle.
- New patient work must target merged surfaces, not standalone CRUD screens.

## Step Ownership (Merged)
- `11_04_01_patients-home.mdc` -> Patients home (`/patients` overview)
- `11_04_02_patients.mdc` -> Patient directory + quick-create + workspace entry
- `11_04_03_patient-identifiers.mdc` -> Identity & Reachability merged workspace surface (`tab=identity`, panels: identifiers/contacts/guardians)
- `11_04_06_patient-allergies.mdc` -> Care Context merged workspace surface (`tab=care`, panels: allergies/histories)
- `11_04_08_patient-documents.mdc` -> Documents + patient consents merged workspace surface (`tab=documents|consents`)
- `11_04_10_terms-acceptances.mdc` -> Global legal hub ownership (`/patients/legal`, tabs: consents/terms)

## Deprecated Compatibility Stubs
- `11_04_04_patient-contacts.mdc` -> deprecated; redirect-compatible scope now owned by `11_04_03`
- `11_04_05_patient-guardians.mdc` -> deprecated; redirect-compatible scope now owned by `11_04_03`
- `11_04_07_patient-medical-histories.mdc` -> deprecated; redirect-compatible scope now owned by `11_04_06`
- `11_04_09_consents.mdc` -> deprecated; redirect-compatible scope now owned by `11_04_08` and `11_04_10`

## Shared Contract Enforcement (Mandatory)
- This file inherits and must fully comply with ../00_shared-contracts.mdc.
- All mandatory contracts in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are required for work executed from this prompt.
- ../00_shared-contracts.mdc has precedence over this file; if instructions conflict, the shared contract wins.
- A task is complete only when this file and every mandatory requirement in ../00_shared-contracts.mdc are satisfied.
