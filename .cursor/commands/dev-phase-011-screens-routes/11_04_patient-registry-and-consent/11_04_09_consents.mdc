Deprecated compatibility stub for **11.4.9** - Consents standalone route.
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Status
- Deprecated in consolidation cycle.
- Ownership moved to:
  - `11_04_08_patient-documents.mdc` (patient-scoped consents in workspace)
  - `11_04_10_terms-acceptances.mdc` (global legal operations)

## Current Route Contract
- Legacy route files under `src/app/(main)/patients/consents/**` must remain redirect-only wrappers to:
  - `/patients/legal?tab=consents`

## Enforcement
- Do not add or restore standalone consents list/detail/create/edit screens.
- Keep wrapper behavior backward-compatible for deep links until next prune cycle.
