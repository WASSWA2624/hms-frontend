Deprecated compatibility stub for **11.4.7** - Patient medical histories.
Load `../00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Status
- Deprecated in consolidation cycle.
- Ownership moved to `11_04_06_patient-allergies.mdc` (Care Context merged workspace).

## Current Route Contract
- Legacy route files under `src/app/(main)/patients/patient-medical-histories/**` must remain redirect-only wrappers to:
  - `/patients/patients/:patientId?tab=care&panel=histories` when patient context exists
  - `/patients/patients` when context is missing

## Enforcement
- Do not add or restore standalone patient-medical-histories screens.
- Keep wrapper behavior backward-compatible for deep links until next prune cycle.
