Step file for **11.3.21** - User sessions.
Load `11_03_settings-and-core-access-modules_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.3.21`
- Route: `(main)/settings/user-sessions`
- Backend module: `user-session`
- Action mode: Read-only route surface (list/detail only).

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(main)/settings/user-sessions/index.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/settings/user-sessions/[id].jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/settings/UserSessionListScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/settings/UserSessionDetailScreen/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/settings/UserSessionListScreen.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/settings/UserSessionDetailScreen.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/settings/useUserSessionListScreen.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/settings/useUserSessionDetailScreen.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/settings-routes.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_03_settings-and-core-access-modules_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- List route (`index`): compact toolbar/actions, search/filter if applicable, and deterministic empty/error/offline states.
- Detail route (`[id]`): human-readable field rendering, role-aware actions, and explicit recovery/back navigation.
- Form routes are not mounted for this step: keep role-aware read-only/informational UX and block unsupported write actions.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
