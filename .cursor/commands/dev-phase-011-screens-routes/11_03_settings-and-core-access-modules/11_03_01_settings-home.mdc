Step file for **11.3.1** - Settings home.
Load `00_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.3.1`
- Route: `(main)/settings`
- Backend module: resolve from mounted settings shell context and selected sub-route.
- Action mode: Settings shell + overview (no CRUD module actions in this step).

## Mounted Route Surface
- `src/app/(main)/settings/_layout.jsx`
- `src/app/(main)/settings/index.jsx`

## Platform Screen Surface
- `src/platform/screens/settings/SettingsScreen/**`
- `src/platform/screens/settings/GeneralSettingsPanel/**`

## Test Surface
- `src/__tests__/platform/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.test.js`
- `src/__tests__/app/(main)/settings-routes.test.js`

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `00_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Ensure `(main)/settings/_layout` wraps child routes with `SettingsScreen` and keeps route transitions stable.
- Ensure `(main)/settings/index` presents `GeneralSettingsPanel` with compact, novice-first defaults.
- Keep contextual help icon pattern in the settings shell and preserve mobile parity across web/android/ios.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Route wiring and guards are correct for this step only.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, offline, and recovery states are covered.
- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
- [ ] IDs shown to standard users are human-readable (no raw UUID/GUID/internal IDs).
- [ ] Tests are updated for allowed and denied/read-only paths.
