Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement selected screen/route wiring and interactions for this tier only.
- Ensure end-to-end backend linkage for enabled actions and role-aware fallbacks when API contract or entitlement blocks an action.
- Apply route/action access control, accessibility semantics, and resilient loading/error/offline states.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Contracts must align with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc`.
- Mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and selected module route files are source of truth.
- Use only mounted backend resources/actions from `hms-backend/src/app/router.js`; do not invent unsupported endpoints.
- If backend changes are required, comply fully with `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/*`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must match mobile web UI for layout, spacing density, typography scale, component sizing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Only create .android or .ios overrides when required by hard platform constraints or accessibility requirements.
- When overrides are required, keep visual and interaction parity with mobile web.
- Prioritize simplicity and space economy: compact layouts, short labels, short helper text, and minimal non-essential copy.
- Add inline/in-app guidance for critical user actions using concise contextual hints and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid long instructional paragraphs in screens; guidance must be brief, actionable, and local to the current step.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this parity and compactness contract.

## Novice-First UX and Navigation Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Design for first-time users with minimal or no prior training; every primary action must be obvious from context.
- Keep user journeys chronological and self-explanatory from start to completion; every next step must be clearly signposted.
- Make navigation between related screens easy and predictable with consistent placement, labels, and back/next patterns.
- Prefer progressive disclosure and role-focused context; show only what the current user needs to complete the current task.
- Pre-fill and auto-resolve known values from trusted context (tenant, facility, user, encounter, branch, etc.) and hide them unless confirmation or compliance visibility is required.
- Enforce strict role and permission visibility for routes, navigation items, widgets, fields, and actions.
- Do not surface unauthorized or irrelevant areas (for example, finance metrics for non-finance roles or registration flows for non-admin operational roles).
- Reuse predefined shared components and established design tokens before creating new UI patterns.
- Keep layouts space-efficient, lightweight, and performant; avoid visual clutter and long static instructions.
- Provide contextual in-app guidance with a help icon pattern; on hover/focus/press it must reveal a tooltip or modal that explains terms, fields, and decisions.
- Include concise guidance for domain sequencing where needed (for example, tenant vs facility and required creation order).
- Ensure terminology, labels, and helper text remain short, clear, and action-oriented across Android, iOS, and web.

## User-Friendly Errors and Recovery Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Display errors in plain language that users can understand without technical training.
- Do not use ambiguous generic text such as "Something went wrong" or "Server error" without context.
- Prefer specific, user-centered messages (for example, "We could not load facility data right now").
- Provide immediate, actionable next steps in the UI (retry, check connection, refresh, confirm permissions, continue in read-only mode when appropriate).
- Distinguish user-correctable issues from system-side issues and tailor guidance accordingly.
- Map validation and business-rule failures to field-level or action-level messages near the relevant control.
- Keep sensitive internals out of UI messages (no stack traces, SQL/errors, secrets, or internal identifiers).
- Store technical diagnostics in logs and telemetry only; surface concise user-facing guidance in the screen.
- For persistent system errors, provide a support handoff path with a user-friendly incident reference and clear instruction to contact support if retries fail.
- Ensure all error/help text remains concise, localized, accessible, and role-appropriate.
- Use contextual help triggers (help icon / tooltip / modal) to clarify domain terms and required action order when confusion is likely.

## Interconnected Functionality Coordination Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Treat related screens and features as one coordinated workflow, not isolated pages.
- Verify upstream and downstream dependencies so updates in one area correctly reflect in all linked areas.
- Keep identifiers, statuses, timestamps, ownership fields, and state transitions consistent across connected modules.
- Ensure actions in one screen (create/update/approve/cancel/assign/close) propagate clearly to dependent queues, summaries, detail views, and dashboards.
- Provide explicit cross-screen navigation handoffs (next step, related records, return path) where workflows span multiple modules.
- Align validation and business rules across interconnected forms to prevent contradictory outcomes between screens.
- Enforce role and permission coordination across linked flows so users only see and trigger actions they are authorized for end-to-end.
- Use shared domain components, hooks, and contracts to avoid duplicated logic and drift between connected features.
- Handle partial failure/offline scenarios with clear reconciliation behavior so linked records do not silently diverge.
- Include cross-functional test coverage for linked journeys, including success, validation, permission-denied, and recovery paths.
## Role-Based Visibility and Access Enforcement Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches auth, routing, navigation, data access, or UI:
- Users must never see or execute anything outside their role and permission scope.
- Enforce access at multiple layers: menu item visibility, route/screen guards, section-level rendering, component-level rendering, and action/function-level handlers.
- Hide unauthorized menu items, tabs, widgets, buttons, fields, cards, and screen sections by default; do not expose privileged controls unless explicitly required by approved requirements.
- Block unauthorized function/action execution even when UI is bypassed (direct URL entry, deep links, state tampering, manual event triggering).
- Use a single source of truth for access checks across web, Android, and iOS to prevent behavior drift.
- Provide deterministic denied-access UX (safe redirect, read-only fallback, or localized permission message) without leaking sensitive details.
- Add/update tests that verify all protected layers: menu visibility, route guards, screen/section/component rendering, and denied function/action paths.
