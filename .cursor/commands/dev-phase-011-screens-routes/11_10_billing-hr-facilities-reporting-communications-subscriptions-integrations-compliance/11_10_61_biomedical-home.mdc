## Mounted Route Surface

## Test Surface

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_10_billing-hr-facilities-reporting-communications-subscriptions-integrations-compliance_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Home route: ensure overview, nav handoff, and role-aware summaries are compact and deterministic.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.
