Step file for **11.11.3** - Patient results.
Load `11_11_shared-contracts.mdc` first.

## Step Metadata
- Step ID: `11.11.3`
- Route: `(patient)/results`
- Backend module: resolve from route/module contracts.
- Action mode: Home/overview route surface.

## Mounted Route Surface

## Implementation Granularity
- Apply all mandatory contracts from `11_11_shared-contracts.mdc` with no omissions.
- Implement only this step route surface unless explicitly selecting additional step IDs.
- Use mounted backend actions only; do not invent endpoints or unsupported write flows.
- Keep mobile parity (web/android/ios), concise contextual help, and human-readable identity display.
- Home route: ensure overview, nav handoff, and role-aware summaries are compact and deterministic.
- Enforce route-level and action-level authorization; never expose unauthorized controls or execution paths.

- [ ] UI is compact, novice-first, and role-aware with contextual help support.
