Steps to review and implement (Phase 013 - Tier 3: Performance and Readiness Gates):
- **13.7** Performance and readiness gates

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Execute only selected finalization gate scope for this tier.
- Prioritize high-risk regressions and readiness blockers first.
- Produce reproducible verification evidence for selected checks.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P013_finalization.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Final readiness and parity checks must align with mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and backend dev-plan contracts.
- Performance assumptions should remain compatible with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P008_perf.mdc`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 013 Tier 3.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs.
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- Selected hardening/audit/performance/parity code paths under `src/**`
- Targeted tests/verification outputs for selected finalization checks
- Minimal docs/checklists required for selected sign-off scope

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT introduce new feature scope during finalization tiers.
- Do NOT skip selected readiness gates.
- Do NOT modify unselected tiers beyond minimal prerequisite wiring.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
