Steps to review and implement (Phase 010 - Tier 17: Reporting & Analytics):
- **10.17.1** `report-definition`
- **10.17.2** `report-run`
- **10.17.3** `dashboard-widget`
- **10.17.4** `kpi-snapshot`
- **10.17.5** `analytics-event`

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement full feature-template files per selected module step(s): rules, model, api, usecase, optional events, and exports.
- Add/update optional store slice and `use<Feature>` hook only when required by selected module scope.
- Complete tests with required coverage gates for rules/models/api/usecase/slice/hook branches.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P010_core-features.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Module order must align with mounted backend modules in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` (and with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P011_modules.mdc` where synchronized).
- Endpoint contracts must align with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc`.
- Mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and module route files are source of truth.
- All Phase 10 modules listed in `P010_core-features.md` are mounted in backend snapshot `2026-02-16`; implement full CRUD-capable feature behavior where the API contract and RBAC allow it.
- If backend changes are required, comply fully with `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/*`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must match mobile web UI for layout, spacing density, typography scale, component sizing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Only create .android or .ios overrides when required by hard platform constraints or accessibility requirements.
- When overrides are required, keep visual and interaction parity with mobile web.
- Prioritize simplicity and space economy: compact layouts, short labels, short helper text, and minimal non-essential copy.
- Add inline/in-app guidance for critical user actions using concise contextual hints and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid long instructional paragraphs in screens; guidance must be brief, actionable, and local to the current step.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this parity and compactness contract.

## Role-Based Visibility and Access Enforcement Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches auth, routing, navigation, data access, or UI:
- Users must never see or execute anything outside their role and permission scope.
- Enforce access at multiple layers: menu item visibility, route/screen guards, section-level rendering, component-level rendering, and action/function-level handlers.
- Hide unauthorized menu items, tabs, widgets, buttons, fields, cards, and screen sections by default; do not expose privileged controls unless explicitly required by approved requirements.
- Block unauthorized function/action execution even when UI is bypassed (direct URL entry, deep links, state tampering, manual event triggering).
- Use a single source of truth for access checks across web, Android, and iOS to prevent behavior drift.
- Provide deterministic denied-access UX (safe redirect, read-only fallback, or localized permission message) without leaking sensitive details.
- Add/update tests that verify all protected layers: menu visibility, route guards, screen/section/component rendering, and denied function/action paths.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 010 Tier 17.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs.
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- `src/features/<module>/**` for selected module step(s)
- `src/store/slices/<module>.slice.js` only when selected step requires global state
- `src/hooks/use<Feature>.js`, `src/features/index.js`, and tests for selected module step(s)

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT merge multiple module child steps into one implementation unit.
- Do NOT implement screen/route UI scope except minimal wiring strictly required by selected module step(s).
- Do NOT use endpoints that are not mounted in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js`.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
