Steps to review and implement (Phase 010 - Tier 16: Notifications & Communications):
- **10.16.1** `notification`
- **10.16.2** `notification-delivery`
- **10.16.3** `conversation`
- **10.16.4** `message`
- **10.16.5** `template`
- **10.16.6** `template-variable`

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement full feature-template files per selected module step(s): rules, model, api, usecase, optional events, and exports.
- Add/update optional store slice and `use<Feature>` hook only when required by selected module scope.
- Complete tests with required coverage gates for rules/models/api/usecase/slice/hook branches.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P010_core-features.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Module order must align with mounted backend modules in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` (and with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P011_modules.mdc` where synchronized).
- Endpoint contracts must align with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc`.
- Mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js` and module route files are source of truth.
- All Phase 10 modules listed in `P010_core-features.md` are mounted in backend snapshot `2026-02-17`; implement full CRUD-capable feature behavior where the API contract and RBAC allow it.
- If backend changes are required, comply fully with `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/*`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must visually and behaviorally match mobile web for layout density, typography scale, component sizing, spacing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Platform-specific override files are allowed only for hard platform/accessibility constraints and must preserve parity with mobile web.
- Keep UI simple, modern, compact, stable, and fully responsive across phone, tablet, and web breakpoints.
- Keep user journeys chronological and obvious for first-time users: clear actions, short labels, and minimal friction.
- Prefer consolidating related actions on one screen when it reduces fragmentation and cognitive load.
- Auto-resolve and hide known context parameters (tenant, facility, branch, user, encounter, and similar context) unless user input is mandatory by contract or compliance.
- Do not show internal model IDs in UI. Display human-readable business IDs/labels from backend or domain data contracts.
- Keep navigation straightforward with stable route structure, stable nav items, and consistent placement of controls.
- Reuse shared platform components/patterns/tokens first; avoid ad-hoc one-off UI implementations.
- Add concise contextual help for critical decisions and keep instructional copy short and local to the action.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this contract.

## Role-Based Visibility and Access Enforcement Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches auth, routing, navigation, data access, or UI:
- Users must never see or execute anything outside their role and permission scope.
- Ensure each role sees the routes, nav items, screens, sections, components, and actions required for their responsibilities; missing required access is a defect.
- Enforce access at multiple layers: menu item visibility, route/screen guards, section-level rendering, component-level rendering, and action/function-level handlers.
- Hide unauthorized menu items, tabs, widgets, buttons, fields, cards, and screen sections by default; do not expose privileged controls unless explicitly required by approved requirements.
- Block unauthorized function/action execution even when UI is bypassed (direct URL entry, deep links, state tampering, manual event triggering).
- Use a single source of truth for access checks across web, Android, and iOS to prevent behavior drift.
- Use canonical backend role names and permission contracts as defined by `hms-backend/.cursor/rules/index.mdc` and backend auth/rbac contracts.
- Provide deterministic denied-access UX (safe redirect, read-only fallback, or localized permission message) without leaking sensitive details.
- Add/update tests that verify protected and required role paths: menu visibility, required route availability, route guards, screen/section/component rendering, and denied function/action paths.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 010 Tier 16.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs after confirming all earlier step IDs in the same phase/tier are already complete; if not, complete missing earlier steps first (no chronology skips).
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps unless an earlier required prerequisite is needed to satisfy mandatory chronology gates.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- `src/features/<module>/**` for selected module step(s)
- `src/store/slices/<module>.slice.js` only when selected step requires global state
- `src/hooks/use<Feature>.js`, `src/features/index.js`, and tests for selected module step(s)

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT merge multiple module child steps into one implementation unit.
- Do NOT implement screen/route UI scope except minimal wiring strictly required by selected module step(s).
- Do NOT use endpoints that are not mounted in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js`.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
