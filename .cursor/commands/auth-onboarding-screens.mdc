Implement step **11.1.3** Resume link sent (check email) -- `(auth)/resume-link-sent` as per `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md`.

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*`
- Backend contracts in `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc` and implemented auth endpoints
- `hms-frontend/special-features/onboarding-journey.md`
- `write-up.md`

Only implement what is required for this single screen to function correctly.

---

## Scope

Implement full functionality required for this screen:

- UI rendering for "check your email" state
- Backend-aligned API call(s) if resend/check is supported
- Validation (email format or token input, if applicable)
- Loading, empty, and error states
- Success/failure feedback
- Navigation (Back / Continue)
- Resume-state handling and deep-link readiness
- Prefill known fields where applicable

Do NOT implement future steps or unrelated onboarding/auth screens.

---

## Layout Rules (Strict)

- Reuse existing **Auth Layout**
- No layout redesign
- No nested scroll containers
- No nested sidebars
- Use existing navigation patterns
- Match current auth/onboarding screens visually

---

## UI / UX Rules

- Clean, compact, modern UI
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop, web, iOS, Android)
- Clear call-to-action hierarchy
- Human-friendly instructional copy via i18n keys
- No duplicate UI
- No oversized elements
- No dead-end navigation

Buttons:
- Use existing auth button styles
- Compact and consistent

---

## Reliability

- Handle API/network errors gracefully
- Human-readable error messages
- Clear resend/continue confirmations
- Disable invalid actions
- Preserve state when possible

All operations MUST match backend schema and endpoint behavior exactly.

---

## Constraints

Do NOT:

- Redefine onboarding logic or flows
- Modify auth layout
- Add global components or patterns
- Change routing architecture
- Invent backend fields or behaviors
- Implement billing, modules, or onboarding steps not required here

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- 100% rules compliance
- Existing auth layout reused
- Backend-aligned API usage
- Responsive UI
- Clear validation and feedback
- Works independently in isolation
- Seamlessly integrates into onboarding journey

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Screen/Page component
2. Form components (if applicable)
3. API integration hooks (if applicable)
4. Validation logic (if applicable)
5. State handling logic
6. Loading + error UI
7. Success feedback implementation
8. Navigation handlers
9. Backend contract alignment confirmation

Do NOT include unrelated files or future onboarding steps.
