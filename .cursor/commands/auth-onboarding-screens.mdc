Implement step **11.1.1** Landing + facility type selection -- `(public)/landing` as per `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P011_screens-routes.md`.

You must ensure 100% compliance to the following:
- All rules defined in `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*`
- hms-backend contracts
- Follow the `hms-frontend/special-features/onboarding-journey.md` for the onboarding implementation 
- Must be in line with the `app write-up.md`
Only implement what is required for this single screen to function correctly.

---

## Scope

Implement full functionality required for this screen:

- Form/UI rendering
- Backend-aligned API calls
- Validation
- Loading, empty, error states
- Success/failure feedback
- Navigation (Back / Cancel / Continue)
- Resume/state handling if applicable
- Prefill known or inferable fields
- Use selects instead of free text where possible

Do NOT implement future steps or unrelated onboarding screens.

---

## Layout Rules (Strict)

- Reuse existing **Auth Layout**
- No layout redesign
- No nested scroll containers
- No nested sidebars
- Use existing navigation patterns
- Match current auth/onboarding screens visually

---

## UI / UX Rules

- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop, web, iOS, Android)
- Logical form flow
- Inline validation
- Required fields clear
- Helpful placeholders and or guiding explanaions
