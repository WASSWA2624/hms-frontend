Steps to review and implement (Phase 009 - Tier 3: Theme, Language, and Global Utilities):
- **9.7** Theme Controls (Light/Dark Only)
- **9.8** Language Selection Controls
- **9.9** Global Banners and Utilities (All Platforms, All Sizes)

Specific implementation scope for this tier:
- Implement user-facing theme/language controls and global utility surfaces.
- Keep all text localized and preserve accessibility feedback for control states.
- Ensure utility components remain platform-consistent and token-driven.

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of this selected tier per:
- hms-frontend/dev-plan/P009_app-layouts.md

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*
- hms-frontend/write-up.md
- Locale and user preference behavior must remain compatible with backend-supported locale/session contracts where applicable.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in hms-frontend/src/**

Only implement what is required for this tier's selected step(s).

## Mobile UI Parity and Compact UX Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches UI (components, screens, layouts, route presentation, copy, interactions, or styling):
- Android and iOS must match mobile web UI for layout, spacing density, typography scale, component sizing, and interaction patterns.
- Use shared-first implementations by default. Only create .android or .ios overrides when required by hard platform constraints or accessibility requirements.
- When overrides are required, keep visual and interaction parity with mobile web.
- Prioritize simplicity and space economy: compact layouts, short labels, short helper text, and minimal non-essential copy.
- Add inline/in-app guidance for critical user actions using concise contextual hints and progressive disclosure.
- Avoid long instructional paragraphs in screens; guidance must be brief, actionable, and local to the current step.
- Keep full compliance with i18n, accessibility, and theme-token rules while applying this parity and compactness contract.

## Role-Based Visibility and Access Enforcement Contract (Mandatory)

For any selected step that touches auth, routing, navigation, data access, or UI:
- Users must never see or execute anything outside their role and permission scope.
- Enforce access at multiple layers: menu item visibility, route/screen guards, section-level rendering, component-level rendering, and action/function-level handlers.
- Hide unauthorized menu items, tabs, widgets, buttons, fields, cards, and screen sections by default; do not expose privileged controls unless explicitly required by approved requirements.
- Block unauthorized function/action execution even when UI is bypassed (direct URL entry, deep links, state tampering, manual event triggering).
- Use a single source of truth for access checks across web, Android, and iOS to prevent behavior drift.
- Provide deterministic denied-access UX (safe redirect, read-only fallback, or localized permission message) without leaking sensitive details.
- Add/update tests that verify all protected layers: menu visibility, route guards, screen/section/component rendering, and denied function/action paths.

## Tier Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- This file covers only the listed step IDs for Phase 009 Tier 3.
- If specific step IDs from this tier are selected, implement only those IDs.
- If the tier is selected as a whole, implement all listed step IDs in order.
- If shared prerequisite wiring is required, implement only the minimum required for this tier.
- Do NOT implement unselected sibling tiers or out-of-tier steps.

---

## Implementation Areas

Primary areas for this tier:
- `src/platform/components/**` controls and utility components used by selected steps
- `src/i18n/**` locale switch wiring and key usage for selected controls
- `src/store/**` or hooks wiring for theme/language state as required

---

## Tier Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT add theme modes beyond light/dark requirements.
- Do NOT add locale files outside current supported set unless selected step explicitly requires it.
- Do NOT add feature-domain logic to global utility components.

---

## Tier Gate Checklist

1. Implement/fix only selected step(s) within this tier.
2. Enforce i18n/accessibility/rules compliance.
3. Add/update tests and edge-path coverage for selected step(s).
4. Run relevant checks/tests and report results.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no out-of-tier scope creep.

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected step(s) in this tier.
2. Related exports/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/check commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming selected step IDs, rule checks, backend/write-up alignment checks, and any justified out-of-scope deferrals.

Do NOT include files or logic outside this tier's selected step(s).
