Steps to review and implement (Phase 001: Foundation Layer):
- **1.1** Create Environment Configuration
- **1.2** Create Application Constants
- **1.3** Create API Endpoints Registry
- **1.4** Create Feature Flags
- **1.5** Create Config Barrel Export
- **1.6** Create Formatting Utilities
- **1.7** Create Validation Utilities
- **1.8** Create Helper Utilities
- **1.9** Create Utils Barrel Export
- **1.10** Create Log Levels
- **1.11** Create Logger Implementation
- **1.12** Create Logging Barrel Export
- **1.13** Create i18n System (do before Error Handler)
- **1.14** Create Error Handler
- **1.15** Create Fallback UI Component
- **1.16** Create Error Boundary Component
- **1.17** Create Errors Barrel Export

Review and implement all missing and non-compliant aspects of the selected Phase 001 step(s) per:
- `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P001_foundation.md`

You must ensure 100% compliance with:
- All rules in `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*`
- `hms-frontend/write-up.md`
- When selected steps touch endpoint registries, align entries with `hms-backend/dev-plan/P010_api_endpoints.mdc` and mounted routes in `hms-backend/src/app/router.js`.
- Actual repository architecture and conventions already in `hms-frontend/src/**`

Only implement what is required for the selected Phase 001 step(s).

## Rule Loading Contract (Mandatory)

Before coding, read and apply:
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/index.mdc` (entry point)
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/core-principles.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/tech-stack.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/dependency-policy.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/app-router.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/platform-ui.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/component-structure.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/theme-design.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/state-management.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/features-domain.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/services-integration.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/hooks-utils.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/offline-sync.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/security.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/i18n.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/accessibility.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/performance.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/errors-logging.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/debug.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/bootstrap-config.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/coding-conventions.mdc`
- `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/testing.mdc`

Conflict resolution order:
- Follow each rule file's declared single source of truth.
- If still unclear, prioritize: `index.mdc` references -> specific single-source files -> phase plan.

---

## Step Selection Contract (Mandatory)

- The request can target one or more step IDs from `1.1 to 1.17`.
- If specific step IDs are selected, implement only those selected IDs.
- If selected steps need minimal shared prerequisite wiring, implement only the minimum prerequisite changes required.
- Do NOT auto-implement unselected sibling steps.
- Apply strict gate execution from `P001_foundation.md`: complete each selected step fully (implementation + tests + compliance checks) before moving to the next selected step.

---

## Scope

- Implement selected foundation steps for config, utils, logging, i18n bootstrap, and error handling.
- Keep all foundation utilities framework-agnostic and reusable across features.
- Maintain strict layering between config/utils/errors and higher app layers.

Primary areas for this phase:
- `src/config/**` (env/constants/endpoints/flags and barrel exports)
- `src/utils/**` and related barrel exports
- `src/logging/**`, `src/errors/**`, and `src/i18n/**` bootstrap files

---

## Implementation Rules (Mandatory)

### Architecture and Boundaries
- Keep layer boundaries from `project-structure.mdc` and `core-principles.mdc`.
- Reuse existing modules/hooks/utilities before creating new abstractions.
- Keep code JavaScript-only (`.js`/`.jsx`) per `coding-conventions.mdc`.
- Follow alias/import/export conventions exactly.

### Styling, UX, and Accessibility
- UI files must use i18n keys for all user-facing copy.
- Enforce accessibility semantics, focus handling, and touch target requirements.
- Use theme tokens only; avoid hardcoded design values.

### Data, Security, and Reliability
- When APIs are involved, use only mounted backend routes and valid DTO/enum shapes.
- Handle loading, empty, error, success, and offline states where applicable.
- Avoid ad-hoc `console.*` and sensitive data exposure in logs/UI.
- Prevent duplicate submissions and race-condition regressions.

### Testing and Verification
- Add/update tests for all changed behavior and required edge paths.
- Respect coverage requirements defined by phase plan and `testing.mdc`.
- Run targeted tests/checks for selected step(s) and report results.

---

## Phase Constraints (Mandatory)

- Do NOT implement feature-domain modules/screens during Phase 1.
- Do NOT add service orchestration/business workflows outside selected foundation steps.
- Do NOT hardcode user-facing strings; i18n bootstrap must stay compliant.

---

## Step Gate Checklist (Mandatory per selected step)

1. Implement/fix only the selected step module/files with compliant structure.
2. Enforce i18n, accessibility, and token/rule compliance.
3. Add/update tests for the selected step behavior and edge cases.
4. Run relevant checks/tests and confirm pass/fail status.
5. Verify no architecture boundary violations.
6. Verify no unselected-step scope creep.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- 100% compliance with all files in `hms-frontend/.cursor/rules/*`.
- Selected step(s) from `hms-frontend/dev-plan/P001_foundation.md` are complete and production-ready.
- Backend integration (if applicable) matches mounted routes and contracts.
- `hms-frontend/write-up.md` alignment is preserved for selected scope.
- Tests and verification gates are satisfied for selected scope.
- No out-of-scope phase/step work was introduced.

---

## Deliverables

Return ONLY:

1. Implementation files changed for selected Phase 001 step(s).
2. Related export/config/wiring updates required by selected step(s) only.
3. i18n locale key updates required by selected step(s).
4. Tests/verification artifacts for selected step(s), including commands run and result summary.
5. A concise compliance report confirming:
   - selected step IDs implemented
   - rule compliance checks performed
   - backend/write-up alignment checks performed
   - any intentionally deferred work (must be out-of-scope and justified)

Do NOT include files or logic outside selected Phase 001 step(s).
