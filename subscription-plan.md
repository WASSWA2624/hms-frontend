`Advanced` is for standard product delivery on customer infrastructure.
`Custom` is required when any of the following is true:
- You need custom feature development or major workflow redesign.
- You need complex multi-system integration beyond standard connectors.
- You require multi-region architecture with contractual resilience targets.
- You require government/enterprise procurement artifacts (SOW, legal controls, audit commitments).
- You require dedicated account governance and custom SLA terms.
