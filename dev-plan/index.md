# HMS Frontend Development Plan

## Purpose
This development plan provides a **complete, step-by-step, chronological guide** for building the React Native (Expo + App Router) HMS application. Each step is **modular**, creates the **smallest unit** of functionality, and ensures **100% compliance** with project rules defined in `.cursor/rules/` and alignment with `hms-backend/write-up.md` plus `hms-backend/dev-plan/`.

## Principles
- **Modularity**: Each step is independent and testable
- **Reproducibility**: Any developer following this plan will produce the same application
- **Rule Compliance**: Every step strictly follows `.cursor/rules/` standards (rules are not redefined here)
- **Incremental**: Each step builds on previous steps
- **Testable**: Every step includes testing requirements

## Development Order
The plan follows the **layered architecture** and **initialization order**, but intentionally implements **reusable app building blocks first** and **app-specific features last**.

**IMPORTANT**: Phases 0-8 are **generic React Native app building blocks** that apply to any React Native application without requiring modifications. HMS-specific implementations start in Phase 9.

1. **Foundation** → Config, Utils, Logging, Errors (generic)
2. **Infrastructure** → Services, Security (generic)
3. **State & Theme** → Store, Theme System (generic)
4. **Offline** → Offline-first architecture + Bootstrap layer (wires security, store, theme, offline) (generic)
5. **Reusable Hooks** → Cross-cutting hooks used by any app (used by UI patterns) (generic)
6. **Reusable Platform UI Foundation** → Primitives, patterns, layouts (no domain coupling) (generic)
7. **App Shell (App Router + Guards)** → Providers, route groups, navigation shell, error routes (generic)
8. **Minimal Runnable App** → Landing page, home screen, error routes (verify app runs before features) (generic)
9. **Core Features** → Implement HMS core modules (auth, tenancy, RBAC, patient registry, scheduling, clinical, diagnostics, pharmacy, inventory, emergency, billing, HR, reporting, notifications, subscriptions, compliance, integrations) (**app-specific starts here**)
10. **Screens & Routes** → Implement screens, routes, and UI wiring for all core modules (**app-specific**)
11. **Advanced Features** → Optional modules and advanced capabilities (telemedicine, patient engagement, AI insights, research, PACS/IoT integrations) (**app-specific**)
12. **Finalization** → Onboarding/help + comprehensive testing/polish (**app-specific**)

## File Structure

- `P004_offline.md` - Offline-first architecture + Bootstrap layer
- `P005_reusable-hooks.md` - Reusable Hooks (cross-cutting hooks; no feature hooks)
- `P006_platform-ui-foundation.md` - Reusable Platform UI Foundation (primitives, patterns, layouts)
- `P007_app-shell.md` - App Shell (App Router + guards + navigation skeleton)
- `P008_minimal-app.md` - Minimal Runnable App (landing page, home screen, error routes)
- `P009_core-features.md` - Core Features (implement HMS modules aligned to backend)
- `P010_screens-routes.md` - Screens & Routes (implement screens, routes, and UI wiring)
- `P011_advanced-features.md` - Advanced Features (optional modules + advanced capabilities)
- `P012_finalization.md` - Finalization (onboarding/help + testing/polish)

## How to Use This Plan
1. Follow steps **sequentially** within each phase
2. Complete **all steps** in a phase before moving to the next
3. Write **tests immediately** after each implementation step
4. Verify **rule compliance** by referencing `.cursor/rules/` files
5. **Do not skip** steps or merge them
6. **Use correct file extensions** (`.jsx` for JSX, `.js` for everything else)
7. **Enforce 100% internationalization** - All UI text must use i18n (see `.cursor/rules/i18n.mdc`)
8. **Enforce mandatory grouping** - All related routes MUST be grouped using parentheses `(group-name)` in `src/app/` (see `.cursor/rules/app-router.mdc`). All related components and screens MUST be grouped using regular folder names (NO parentheses) in `src/platform/` (see `.cursor/rules/component-structure.mdc`)

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `index.md` (this file)
2. **Review** relevant rules in `.cursor/rules/` before starting each phase
3. **Start** with `P000_setup.md`
4. **Follow** each phase sequentially
5. **Complete** all steps in a phase before moving to next
6. **Test** after each implementation
7. **Verify** rule compliance at each step

## Rule References
All implementation steps follow rules defined in `.cursor/rules/`:
- `core-principles.mdc` - Fundamental principles
- `project-structure.mdc` - Folder structure
- `tech-stack.mdc` - Technology stack
- `bootstrap-config.mdc` - Initialization order
- And all other rule files as needed

**Note**: This dev-plan contains **implementation steps only**. Rules are defined in `.cursor/rules/` and should be referenced, not redefined here.
